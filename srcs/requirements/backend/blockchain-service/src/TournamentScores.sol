/// @notice Lightweight append-only on-chain storage for tournament score submissions.
///
/// Design goals:
/// 1. Keep on-chain logic minimal and cheap: store entries (nicknameHash, score) in insertion order.
/// 2. Prevent duplicate submissions per tournament using a mapping of nickname hashes.
/// 3. Allow a single on-chain owner (deployer) to create tournaments; score submissions are open to any account.
///
/// Notes:
/// - nicknameHash is expected to be keccak256(lowercase(nickname)) to avoid case collisions; the contract stores the hash only.
/// - Leaderboard ordering is insertion order. Clients or off-chain services should compute rank/sort if needed.
/// - Reading the full leaderboard copies storage to memory and may be gas intensive for large tournaments; prefer pagination or off-chain reads.
